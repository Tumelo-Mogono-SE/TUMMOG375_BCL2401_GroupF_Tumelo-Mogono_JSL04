# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

# Project Overview:

In this coding exercise, I worked with Monster Ternary Operator's. I used ternary operators to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks.

In each of these challenges, the ternanry operator is used to decide between two options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility  for consise conditional logic. While ternaries can make the code more succinct, they should be used judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.

# Utilizing Ternary operator's

* For each challenge, I created a variable which has assigned to it the ternary operator logic which will be used for the conditional statement.
* For each Ternary operator I used the parenthesis to highlight or indicate the condition of the statement.
* I also used string literals for the console.log's throughout each challenge and called the variable using the ${} symbols.

# Challenges
During this project I had no challenges, the objectives were straight forward. All I had to do was to understand the difference in utilizing if statements and using ternary operator. After understanding that aspect it was straight forward for me to work on each task.

# Feedback
I have no feedback for this challenge, I just liked how we worked on implementing ternary operators for different types of conditions and having to work on one challenge which requires a condition with two statements.
